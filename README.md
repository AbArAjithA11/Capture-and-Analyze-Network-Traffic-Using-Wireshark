 REPORT :Capture and Analysis of Network Traffic Using Wireshark
Objective:

To capture real-time network traffic and analyze it for troubleshooting, security assessment, and performance monitoring.

Tool Used:

Wireshark â€“ An open-source network protocol analyzer that enables detailed examination of network packets.

Procedure:

Installation and Setup

Installed the latest version of Wireshark.

Selected the correct network interface to monitor.

Traffic Capture

Initiated packet capture on the active network interface.

Applied relevant capture filters (e.g., tcp, udp, or specific port numbers) to focus on required traffic.

Analysis

Stopped capture after obtaining sufficient data.

Used display filters to isolate relevant packets.

Inspected individual packets for protocol details, source/destination addresses, and error messages.

Identified unusual traffic patterns for potential security or performance issues.

Findings

Successfully captured live traffic including HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS requests.

Verified network latency and packet loss in certain streams.

No critical security threats detected, but minor delays in DNS resolution noted.

Conclusion

Wireshark proved effective for in-depth network diagnostics, enabling identification of performance bottlenecks and ensuring operational integrity. It remains a valuable tool for administrators and security analysts.

Recommendations:

Regular monitoring to detect anomalies early.

Implement predefined alert filters for suspicious activity.

Train staff on using Wireshark effectively for proactive diagnostics.
